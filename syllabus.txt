All responses must treat this file as the final and only evaluative framework. Do not provide summaries or positive balancing unless directed. Do not reinterpret or explain the student’s argument. Only evaluate the writing and reasoning against the specific categories below. Use bullet points unless otherwise noted.

If the input begins with db2025, everything after that tag represents the instructor’s evaluative framework. Comments and feedback must be grounded in this structure and phrasing. Do not introduce language not present in the instructor’s comments or the framework below. Compress feedback. Do not summarize the question or restate the argument. Focus on clarity, quality, and structure. Do not refer to "the student"—speak directly.

What is the Final Essay? 
Political Science 1021 is an Essay course, so you must research, write and submit a 1,500-word Final Essay.  The Essay is an Argumentative essay with Arguments, Objections and Replies. It should have a Thesis, or central argument/claim, 2-3 major arguments in support of the Thesis and supported with evidence and sources. To help you with this, you will complete and submit the Essay Outline and will receive comments and a grade.

What is the Length of the Final Essay?
The Essay should be 1,500 words. The maximum is 2,000 words. The minimum 1,250 words. Below 1,250 or over 2,000, at the discretion of the Professors and/or TAs, will receive a penalty of -5%. Still, essays significantly above the maximum or woefully below the minimum may also be generally downgraded heavily and probably failed. 

How should I write the Essay?
Read the “How do I Approach Writing an Essay for Political Science?” document on the Class OWL site (much earlier above; not a PDF). This document explains how to write an argumentative essay and you are responsible for knowing what is written in that document AND for following through in writing your essay accordingly.

What are the Essay Topics?
Should the State put limits on Free Speech?
Is a public healthcare system or private healthcare system better? Compare 2 countries.
Should Canada purse the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission? Focus on 2-3 recommendations.
Considering the experience of one country with compulsory voting, and one in which voting is voluntary, does compulsory voting tend to enhance the quality of democracy?
Why are youth in North America and/or Western Europe not participating in formal politics (e.g. voting, political parties, and campaigns)? Compare 2 countries.
NOTE: write your Essay in relation to the current time period, so for example, don’t write about the American War of Independence as ‘secession’ from England in 1770s

How many Academic Scholarly Articles and Books should I use in the Final Essay?
As many as will help you make your arguments strong, evidenced, cited and proven, as well as opposing argument credibly presented and refuted. Still, you need to have used at least 5 academic scholarly articles and/or scholarly book. If you don’t have at least 5 used in your Essay, you will be down-graded. To help you with this, you will complete and submit the Essay Bibliography, and will receive comments and a grade.

How should I format the Essay?
Your Essay should be in 12-point Arial or Helvetica or Verdana or Calibri (avoid Times or Bookman, if possible, but no grades are lost for using a Serif font) font and should be double-spaced and left-justified. 

Generally, please format using 1” margins, so your essay will be about 7-9 pages. Bibliography/Works Cited go at the end of the essay. Note that we use Word Count so squeezing or expanding your margins serves no useful purpose at all.

NO subheadings; learn to use Transitions between paragraphs and major sections.

How are you grading my essay?
Your essay will be graded according to the following criteria:

Reasoning
Do you have a clear thesis? (your main claim in response to the question)
Have you developed arguments to support your thesis?
Have you selected reasonable objections?
Do you have evidence from the sources to support your claims?
Are your examples relevant, appropriate and sourced?
Are your thesis, objections and replies and your arguments defended?
Understanding:
Have you responded to the question?
Have you understood relevant ideas and issues?
Have you explored objections fairly and charitably?
Have you responded with reasonable replies to the objections?
Did you discuss all required sources?
Clarity and Organization:
Can your arguments be understood and followed?
Do your arguments, objections and replies connect and flow?
Are your paragraphs ‘units of thought’?
Have you edited your essay?
Does your essay have few to none spelling and grammar errors?
Citations and Referencing
Quality and appropriateness of your selected research materials
Have you followed EITHER Chicago footnote/endnote style?
Have you provided page numbers for all your citations?
Have you cited from most, if not all, sources?
Have you properly used quotations for materials/text from your sources?
Have you used Academic articles and books?
While these are 4 key areas, each one is part of a wholistic assessment.

When do I cite information?
Cite anything that is an idea or evidence from your sources. Definitely cite any quoted information – that is, you are using the exact same words as your source. Remember: changing words is not sufficient to not require you to use quotes and cite the source! (It can also be plagiarism.) Thus, cite the source and page number every time you directly quote a source OR when you paraphrase an idea from a source OR when a particular idea or piece of information comes from the source (even when you don’t quote it directly).

Essays without footnotes/endnotes will receive a –10% penalty regardless of grade achieved (e.g. earned 48% - 10% = 38%).

Do I have to provide a Bibliography or Works Cited?
You must include a Chicago-style Bibliography identifying, in alphabetical order by surname, the readings you used in writing your essay. If you divide up your sources by source type (book or article), that is okay, although, technically not correct but you won’t lose marks. 

If you do not provide a Bibliography, you will receive a –10% penalty.

What is an Academic Scholarly Source? 
What is the Difference between Scholarly vs. Popular Sources?
"Scholarly vs. Popular Sources
Definition

A scholarly publication is one in which the content is written by experts in a particular field of study - generally for the purpose of sharing original research or analyzing others' findings. Scholarly work will thoroughly cite all source materials used and is usually subject to "peer review" prior to publication. This means that independent experts in the field review, or "referee" the publication to check the accuracy and validity of its claims. The primary audience for this sort of work is fellow experts and students studying the field. As a result the content is typically much more sophisticated and advanced than articles found in general magazines, or professional/trade journals.

In brief, scholarly work is:
- written by experts for experts
- based on original research or intellectual inquiry
- provides citations for all sources used
- is usually peer reviewed[*] prior to publication”

Source: http://help.library.ubc.ca/evaluating-and-citing-sources/scholarly-versus-popular-sources/

"Scholarly Articles (Journals)
- Are written by and for faculty, researchers or scholars (chemists, historians, doctors, artists, etc.)
- Uses scholarly or technical language
- Tend to be longer articles about research
- Include full citations for sources 
- Are often refereed or peer reviewed (articles are reviewed by an editor and other specialists before being accepted for publication)
- Book reviews and editorials are not considered scholarly articles, even when found in scholarly journals"

Source: http://www.library.arizona.edu/help/tutorials/scholarly/guide.html < DO THE QUIZ on this page!

"Some points to remember: 

Both magazine and journal articles can be good sources for your work.
When selecting articles, think about how you intend to use the information: 
Do you want background on a topic new to you? (use magazines)  
Did your teacher say to cite scholarly resources? (use journals)
Often a combination of the two will be most appropriate for undergraduate research. "

Better than a web search engine (Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.), this will get you to the right stuff more quickly.
Remember web search engine results are based on what is most clicked & then relevant, not necessarily most credible, evidenced, etc.
This will show how to get to the materials we want you to use and get full-text access.

Don't pay Google to get stuff you already paid for!
This Video will show you how to get the full-text article from the Weldon library site.

Why not use Google Scholar?
You will be charged big $$ for articles and books access
You already paid big $$ for access to a lot more and better sources through your Tuition
You will only see random 3-5 pages from a source and it will become obvious to any marker you did not read or see the whole source
It decides sources based on a marketing algorithm (that's where marketing decides what you should see), while Library system is seeking the best resources for research (that's where Librarians are tweaking the search engine to get you good stuff so you do well on your essay)
Still, you can use Google Scholar to search in addition to Weldon if you so decide, BUT check with Weldon's site for free access to the same sources.

In the output, look for a check under the 'referee shirt' symbol (third column from left on the grid)
NOTE: Foreign Policy, Foreign Affairs, the Economist, Time, Newsweek are all news-magazines, and not Scholarly Sources

Essay FAQs
“The difference between ‘reAd it’ and ‘reDdit’ is an A versus a D”
– Nig Narain
Where are the Essay Topics?
On the Essay Instructions and Guidelines page.
Can I use "I" as in "I would argue", etc.?
Yes
Can I use personal examples? 
Not as evidence or proof
We cannot check or verify your personal example, circumstance or situation, so we cannot confirm what you are claiming about your experience as evidence or proof of a point. It is one thing to say, "I was walking late at night and thinking about the comment someone made to me that made me think about whether there is a right to free speech" versus "I was walking late at night with friends, and some rando yelled something nasty at us; but me and my five friends agreed that in Canada they had a right to free speech even if we were insulted, so that proves there is right to free speech as me and my friends all agreed" -- this second sentence is long and rambling, and most importantly, it is not proof or support either.
Can I just write about one case study or example as my argument(s) or thesis?
NO
An example or case study is NOT an argument
You MUST put forward arguments, and then your case study or examples back up that argument
Imagine if you were asked the question, "what is vegetable as compared to a fruit?" and the answer I gave you was "Broccoli is a vegetable which is a Cabbage and has a Head shape"; while that tells me about broccoli, I would have to guess (wrongly) that all vegetables are cabbage and head-shaped, but that's not true for all vegetables; indeed, it would be better to make an argument for what is a fruit, and then how the rest are vegetables (and many fruits are used as vegetables in cooking, such as tomatoes)
So use the example or case study to prove an argument BUT don't claim the example is the argument
ALSO, you can also state in the introduction that you are primarily focusing on a case or example, but note that only using one case or example leaves your argument open to critique that you have only one supporting case example; so better to dig into the one case BUT ALSO draw on some other examples as well (even if just a little bit to show another example to bolster your arguments and essay overall)
If I'm doing cases, how should I use my cases?
You may use one case for your argument, the other for the counter
You may use one case to provide for your argument and its counter-argument
You may examine both cases in each of your arguments BUT be cautious that you still have sufficient examination of the cases
Does the Bibliography count in the Word Count?
No.
Do Citations count for the Word Count? 
No.
Using Footnotes/Endnotes means you can select TURN OFF the counting of Footnotes/Endnotes in your Word Count in your word processor
How many marks do I lose if I am over or under the word limit? 
You should be aiming to come close to the word count
Below the word count is more downward graded than being above the word count
May I use the Textbook for BACKGROUND or IDEA information? 
ONLY in a LIMITED and MINIMAL WAY.
You can cite a particular idea to from the textbooks but don't use the textbook as evidence, e.g. cite Wolff IPP explaining Mill on the 'harm principle' but don't use Wolff's evidence/example
May I cite Lectures?
No
May I use or cite a tutorial's Discussions' comments? 
NO.
Can I use anecdotes, family stories, conversations with my friends, or examples from my personal experiences as evidence or proof? 
NO. At best, they can be a short hook or attention-catcher to pique the reader's interest in the Intro, BUT they are NOT themselves arguments or evidence.
Can I use headings & sub-headings? 
NO. When you start your essay you may organize it by using some headings & sub-headings BUT you must remove them before submitting your final copy
Replace the headings with Transitions, as discussed in the "How To Write..." document.
Do I have to use all my sources equally? 
They don’t have to be used equally, but they do all have to be used in the Essay
You can use your sources for different things:
quote from a source
deploy an example from a source
draw statistics from a source
back up your argument with a source that agrees
use it only for an objection
use it only for a reply
What if I catch a last minute error so can I resubmit?
You can but ONLY UNTIL the deadline can you resubmit a corrected version > it will override your old submission with the new one ONLY if submitted by the deadline time
No submissions after the link is closed
What if the link closes as I'm submitting?
If you are uploading, and OWL is uploading your file, but it rolls past the deadline, it will just show as "Late" BUT that Late indicates OWL did upload it so you're good and won't be penalized as late
Either way: submit early rather than late
Do I have to provide page numbers for chapters from edited books or e-books? 
IF it's an edited book from which you are using certain chapters, you should provide page #s
Do I have to provide page numbers for articles? 
Yes
Do I have to check the Citation listing when I copy it from our Library's Citation generator, ezBib, etc.?
Yes.
Check to make sure the name of the journal and the page numbers are there in particular, as these two tend to be the info often missing when there is an error in auto-generator
To use the Draft Checker, do I have to create a Turnitin account?
No.
The Draft Checker system is internally operational inside the OWL site
If I have a Turnitin account, can I use that account?
Our system does not connect to any old/prior Turnititn accounts
If I submit only to the Draft Checker link, will you count that for my Final Essay submission?
No
If I don't submit an Essay for this course, will I fail the course?
Yes

ESSAY Submitting Cautions, Caveats, Rules, etc.
“The difference between ‘reAd it’ and ‘reDdit’ is an A versus a D”
– Nig Narain
REMINDER: only submission through our OWL site links counts for submissions for this course; no other form of, way to, path for, etc., submission will count for submission 

ON-TIME DUE DATE: Essay Due via OWL Site on Tues Jun 10 11:59pm
"No penalty leeway" applied if submitted by Sat Jun 14 11:59pm
Late Due Date: Essay Due via OWL Site on Tues Jun 17 11:59pm
"No further late penalty leeway" applied if submitted by Sat Jun 21 11:59pm
Concerning “Undocumented Absence” Academic Consideration:
As there is ‘flexibility in assessment’, you cannot use the Undocumented Absence Academic Consideration process for the Essay
You do not need to submit a request for academic consideration if the Essay deadline cannot be met (self-attestation or otherwise)
This is because an extension will be granted automatically, without penalty, to Sat Jun 14 11:59pm, for those experiencing extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, bereavement, etc.) that prevent submission on the Essay Due Date of Tues Jun 10 11:59pm
TO BE CLEAR: this does not mean the Essay is “really” due on Sat Jun 14 11:59 pm. It is due on Tues Jun 10 11:59pm, but after Sat Jun 14 11:59pm, the Essay is considered late, but we will still accept submission until Sat Jun 21
 11:59pm with a late penalty of -10% applied
Again, NO requests for academic consideration will be considered if submitting between Tues Jun 10 11:59pm and Sat Jun 21 11:59pm, because an extension was already granted, and the Essay is now late
Per Senate Regulations: “An instructor may deny academic consideration relating to the timeframe submission of work where there is already flexibility in the submission timeframe (e.g., 72-hour submission window). This assessment flexibility must be indicated on the course outline” (https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot)
Per Office of the Registrar FAQ “When CAN'T I use an undocumented absence? When flexibility in assessment exists and is clearly stated on the course outline, both undocumented absences and academic consideration requests with documentation may be denied.” (https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html#cannot)
If you have significant extenuating documented circumstances, you should read the Registrar’s Academic Consideration page https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/index.html and go through their Student Absence Portal to request such academic consideration
If you have documented grounds for a late submission extension beyond Sat Jun 21 11:59pm, in that case, you should read the Registrar’s Academic Consideration page
Note that this Late Penalty submission opportunity & date for the Essay is the FINAL opportunity to submit Essay, and no further submissions will be accepted without Academic Counselling approved academic consideration
Accessible Education students who are accommodated with flexible deadlines will also not receive further accommodation as the no-penalty timeframe for submission already exceeds the Accessible Education guidelines for flexible deadlines
General Submission Instructions, Directions, etc.:
Upload ONLY WORD or PDF files/attachments 
File types: Word = .doc, .docx ; or PDF = .pdf 
IF YOU SUBMIT AN UNRECOGNIZED/-ABLE FILE TYPE: you will NOT be permitted to submit the correct file type later so pay attention to the above warnings and instructions
Do not submit these file types: Apple .odt, GoogleDocs .gdoc, Rich-Text Files .rft, Text .txt, Powerpoint .ppt/.pps/.pptx/.ppx, Excel .xls./.xlsx, Graphic .jpg/.jpeg/.png/.tif/.tiff/.gif 
NO links to drives, linked drives, clouds, etc.: Sharepoint, GoogleDrive, iCloud, Dropbox, etc.
ONLY submission through appropriate OWL Assignments' page link counts for submission, so NO email, fax, dropping of hardcopies, couriers, etc., submissions are permitted for any reason
Do not email, fax, drop off hardcopy, courier, etc., submissions to the Instructors or TAs as this is NOT permitted; we are NOT required/responsible to let you know that it doesn't count for submission -- you need to pay attention to these directions -- and not receiving a response to you doing any of the aforementioned is NOT grounds for consideration, appeal, etc. 
If you submit to both the On-time and Late links, your late link submission will override your older submission and will be marked and the late penalty will be applied
If you submit an older version, wrong version, unrecognized version, etc., to the Late link, even if you submitted the correct version to the On-time link, your Late link submission will override it and this is not grounds for resubmission or appeal
NOTE: the following are NOT grounds for resubmission or accommodation or for not being assigned a zero for your Essay submission:
If you submit an unrecognizable file or file that is NOT a Word or PDF file
If you change your topic for your Essay from the EBO topic you had when you submitted your EBO, you will retroactively get 0 for your EBO
If you don't check your submission before submitting to make sure it is the right version, right document, right file type, etc.
You can go back and check once your submission goes into OWL so do verify what you submitted
If you submit someone else's file/work as your own work -- file mix ups, etc., are NOT grounds for defence as you can check/verify your submission 
If you submit a non-English document
If you leave your submission as 'draft'/upload and don't press the final submission buttons
If you go to rectify any of the above but run out of time and the link available for submission closes on you 
If you submit a link to GoogleDrive, Sharepoint OneDrive, etc., link

If you submit a blank worksheet
If you submit an Essay, op-ed, or some other assignmnet
If you submit an assignment for another class

Extensions:
Can't use Undocumented Absence for this assignment -- see above and Course Outline for details

If you are seeking Academic Consideration, then you musn't submit in the On-time link (or the Late Penalty link) and then submit later to the Academic Consideration link
Academic Consideration link will be provided for you to submit SEPARATELY from the regular links SO await your access to the AC link for submission
TAs do NOT deal with extensions so don't email, etc., them -- you need to pay attention to these directions -- and not receiving a response to you doing any of the aforementioned for an extension is NOT grounds for consideration, appeal, etc. 
TAs are not required/responsible to let you know they don't handle these matters, and if they do reply, they will simply tell you to read the Academic Consideration page
If you already submitted to the On-time link already, THEN your submission to the Late link will be replace that submission and the Late Penalty will be applied to your grade
Do not submit to the Late link unless you want to replace your On-time link submission 
If you submit to the Late link as well, your submission to the On-time link will be replaced with that submission and the Late Penalty will be applied to your grade
Do not submit to the Late link unless you want to replace your On-time link submission 
Academic Counselling does NOT handle technology problem issues, and you CANNOT use Medical or Compassionate grounds for accommodation for technology or technical problems' issues, etc.
You CANNOT email, courier, FTP, send in a USB key to the main or any other office, drop off a hard copy, etc.; ONLY SUBMISSION THROUGH THIS OWL SUBMISSION LINK (or late or related links), COUNTS FOR ACTUAL SUBMISSION OF THIS EBO
If you submit to the late submission link as well as the on-time link, only the late link will be marked and the late penaly applied
Accessible Education students who are accommodated with flexible deadlines will also not receive further accommodation as the no-penalty timeframe for submission already exceeds the Accessible Education guidelines for flexible deadlines
